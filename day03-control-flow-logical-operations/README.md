## Description 




## Learning Path
- basic python:
  - `Comparison Operators`:
    - `>`  -- greater than
    - `<`  -- less than
    - `>=` -- greater than equal to
    - `<=` -- less than equal to
    - `==` -- equals to
    - `!=` -- does not equal to
  - `Modulo Operator`: % returns the remainder of dividing the left hand operand by the right hand operand. 
  - `if/else statement`: if `condition` `do this` else `do this instead`
  - `Nested if/esle statement`: same theory as `if/else` statements except they are in a nested fashion
  - `Logical Operators`: 
    - `A` AND `B` ---> both `A` and `B` HAVE TO BE TRUE || if just one of them is TRUE than the overall results to FALSE
    - `C` OR `D`  ---> only if both statements are FALSE is when itll return FALSE
    - NOT `E`     ---> this reverses a condition; if condition is FALSE it will become TRUE || if condition is TRUE it will become FALSE
