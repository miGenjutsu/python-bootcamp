`Exercise 2.2 - BMI Calculator: README`

`./day02-data-types/exercise02-bmi-calculator/.`

## Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

***Warning*** you should convert the result to a whole number.


## Example Input
```sh
weight = 80
height = 1.75
```

## Example Output
```sh
80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
26
```

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:
