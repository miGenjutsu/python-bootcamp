## Description 




## Learning Path
- basic python:
  - `Comparison Operators`:
    - `>`  -- greater than
    - `<`  -- less than
    - `>=` -- greater than equal to
    - `<=` -- less than equal to
    - `==` -- equals to
    - `!=` -- does not equal to
  - `Modulo Operator`: % returns the remainder of dividing the left hand operand by the right hand operand. 
  - `if/else statement`: if `condition` `do this` else `do this instead`
  - `Nested if/esle statement`: same theory as `if/else` statements except they are in a nested fashion
