# Python Variables

# `variable = name` and will be printed out later using the print() function
name = input("What is your name? ")

# printing out the stored `name` variable
print("How are you "+ name + "?")
print(" ")

# creating a new variable and hard coding a name in to later call
name2 = "zelda"
print(name2)


# previous challenge now using `variables`
name = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# print("character length: " + length + ".")
