`Exercise 5.1 - Average Height: README`

`./day05-python-loops/exercise01-average-height/.`

## Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of Heights.

e.g. 

``` bash
student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
```

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

``` bash
180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
```

There are a total of `7` heights in **student_heights**

``` bash
1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572
```

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = **164**

**Important** You should not use the **sum()** or **len()** functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.


## Example Input

``` bash
156 178 165 171 187
```

In this case, **student_heights** would be a list that looks like: `[156, 178, 165, 171, 187]`

## Example Output

``` bash
171
```
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

## Hint

- Remember to use the **round()** function to round the average height before you print it.
