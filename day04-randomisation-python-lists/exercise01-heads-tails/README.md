`Exercise 4.1 - Heads or Tails: README`

`./day04-randomisation-and-python/exercise01-heads-or-tails/.`


## Instructions

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.

e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails


## Example Output
```
Heads
```
or
```
Tails
```

When you're happy with your code, click submit.

## Testing Your Code

Check your code is doing what it is supposed to. When you're happy with your code, click submit to check your solution. Your program may look like it is failing the tests when it isn't. We're using the random functionality in this exercise, so the tests will match different outcomes.
