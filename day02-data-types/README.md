`day02-Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings: README`

`./README.md`

## Description 

Day 02 of 100, on this day alot of the basic form of python was explained. After today using Python I'm now able to do basic python abilities like `print` to screen a message, recieve `user input` from keyboard, and a full understanding of `variables` and the importance of using them.

In this directory contains all the needed examples of todays learning activity and well placed commenting for later reference.

## Learning Path
- basic python:
  - `print()`: allows print message to screen
  - `input()`: allow user input
  - `variables`: a place holder for later use
