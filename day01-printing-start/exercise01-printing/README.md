`Exercise 1.1 - Printing: README`

`./day01-printing-start/exercise01-printing/.`

## Instructions

Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.



## Example Output

After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:
```
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')
```

e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:
