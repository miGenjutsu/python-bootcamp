`Lecture - Variables: README`

`./day01-printing-start/lecture/py-variables/.`

## Learning Path

- `variable = name` and will be printed out later using the print() function
- printing out the stored `name` variable
```sh
print("How are you "+ name + "?")
print(" ")
```
- creating a new variable and hard coding a name in to later call
```sh
name2 = "zelda"
print(name2)
```
- previous challenge now using `variables`
```sh
name = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(name)
print(length)
```
