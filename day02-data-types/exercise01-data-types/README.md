## Instructions

Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

***Warning***. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

## Example Input
```sh
39
```

## Example Outpu
```sh
3 + 9 = 12
12
```

## Hint

- Try to find out the data type of two_digit_number.
- Think about what you learnt about subscripting.
- Think about type conversion.
